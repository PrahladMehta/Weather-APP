# Weather-APP

This project is a simple weather app that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specific location. 
was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly interface. The app leverages the
OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and display it to the users. By entering a location, users can access
information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather conditions. The app provides
a practical and quick way to stay informed about the weather.
